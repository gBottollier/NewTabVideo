### Adding / Removing Videos
Once you've installed the extension, follow these steps to add videos:

- Open a new tab.
- Click on the folder button located in the top left corner of the NewTabVideo extension (shown on mouse hover). This will copy the path of the app to the clipboard.
- Open File Explorer (or equivalent) on your computer.
- Paste the copied path into the address bar of File Explorer and press Enter.
- You will now be in the folder where the extension is installed. Place your desired video files into the "videos" folder within this directory.

Note: Due to privacy restrictions in Google Chrome, I'm unable to directly open File Explorer to assist you in adding videos.
